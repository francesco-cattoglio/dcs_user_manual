\section{User Interface}

\subsection{Basic concepts}
The central element of the user interface is the node graph editor. Inside it
you create and link nodes of different type to assemble the scene containing all
the computed objects.

There are several different kind of nodes, each with a different functionality
and a different number of inputs, but only one output. This output contains
some data that can be used as an input to one or more nodes, simply by
linking to them. While the same output can be used as input to multiple nodes,
the opposite is an error: you cannot use data coming from 2 outputs into the same input.
The data used in the graph is of one of the following types:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Geometry}
    \item \texttt{Vector}
    \item \texttt{Matrix}
    \item \texttt{Time Transform}
    \item \texttt{Interval}
    \item \texttt{Value}
\end{itemize}

One can only connect an output to an input of the same type. For example, it
would not make sense to pass an \textbf{Interval} to a node that requires
a \textbf{Matrix} input.

\subsection{Data types}
\subsubsection{Geometry type}
The most important data type is \textbf{Geometry}. This represents a generic geometric
object, it might be a point, a curve, a surface or a pre-fabricated mesh.
Most of the time we start by creating a geometry of some sort, then
manipulate it with transform functions, and in the end plug the result
into a Renderer node that is the one that turns our data into something
that we visualize on screen.
As we will see later on, parametric transformations and sampling operations
can change the geometric dimension of a Geometry object. As an example,
a given curve can become a surface by applying a parametric transform to it.

\subsubsection{Vector type}
As the name implies, the data contained in this type is just a vector with
user-chosen $x$, $y$ and $z$ coordinates. There is however a very important
difference between a vector and a point: a vector is \textbf{not} a Geometry and
can \textbf{only} be used to build a translation Matrix, as a plane normal or for
visualization purposes. This is because the vector is to be intended as a direction,
not as a generic coordinate in the 3D space. If we write a vector
in homogeneous coordinates, its $w$ component is \textbf{always zero}.

\subsubsection{Matrix type}
This data contains a 4x4 matrix which should be interpreted as a transformation written in
homogeneous coordinates. The matrix can be either parametric or a constant-valued one.
See the nodes section of this chapter to know more about the different matrices that can
be created.

\subsubsection{Time Transform}
This is a very specific 4x4 matrix with an implicit parameter named $t$ as in \textit{time}.
By writing out time-dependent expressions, the user can attach some animation to 
a rendered Geometry object. This can be useful for example to show the movement of a
point along a curve, or to display how a transformation progressively deforms an object
into a final shape.

\subsubsection{Interval and Value}
Both \textbf{Interval} and \textbf{Value} data deals with parameters: the first contains
the parameter and its interval boundaries, while the second contains the parameter and
a specific value in its interval, to be used in a \textbf{Sample parameter} node.

\subsection{Nodes}
When right-clicking on some empty space inside the node graph editor, a popup menu
will open to display all the available node types, grouped by categories.
Clicking on one menu item will place the newly-created node of the corresponding type.

\subsubsection{Geometry > Curve}
Inputs: Interval
Fields: fx, fy, fz
Output: a 1D Geometry object

This node is used to create a parametric curve using a parameter as defined in
Interval and with the given expressions for fx, fy and fz. Simple to use,
just make sure to create an expression using the correct parameter name
(i.e. the same name used inside the Interval given as input)

\subsubsection{Geometry > Bezier}
Inputs: 2, 3 or 4 Points (0D Geometry objects)
Fields: Quality
Output: a 1D Geometry object

This node uses its inputs as control points for a Bezi\`er curve. The degree of the
curve depends on how many inputs have been connected. Empty inputs are ignored.
The Quality field determines how many points will be used to approximate the ideal
Bezi\`er.

\subsubsection{Geometry > Surface}
Inputs: 2 Intervals
Fields: fx, fy, fz
Output: a 2D Geometry object

Similarly to the curve node, this can be used to create a parametric surface
given two intervals and the given expressions for fx, fy and fz.
Both intervals are required, and the user should make sure to use both of them,
since if one is ignored it is likely that nothing will be visualized as a result,
since that will create a degenerated surface.

\subsubsection{Geometry > Plane}
Inputs: one point (0D Geometry), one Vector
Fields: none
Output: a Mesh Geometry object

This node takes one point and a normal vector to create a special representation
of a plane. In particular, the representation consists of an evely-spaced grid centered
about the point given as input.

Please note the output is \textbf{not} a 2D Geometry, but a Mesh Geometry,
which means that the purpose of this node is to have something useful for
visualization purposes, not to have a built-in parametric surface.
It is not allowed to apply a parametric transform to a Mesh Geometry,
only a constant-valued transform or a time-dependant transform can be applied to it.

\subsubsection{Geometry > Primitive}
Inputs: none
Fields: Kind (a drop-down menu), Size
Outputs: a Mesh Geometry object

This node allows the user to create a basic primitive of the given kind
(Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Pyramid or a Dice). The Size fields allows
adjusting the primitive dimensions. See the question mark next to the 
slider for a description of how this value effects the output.

Just like the Plane node, the output is a Mesh Geometry, which is useful
for quick visualization or similar purposes. Again, only constant-valued
or time-dependent transforms can be applied to this object,
parametric transforms are not allowed.

\subsubsection{Parameters > Interval}
Inputs: None
Fields: Name, Begin, End, Quality
Outputs: Interval

This node defines a parameter. By assigning a name, you will then be able
to use this parameter in expressions for parametric curves, surfaces and matrices.
Begin and End define the closed range in which the parameter lives, while quality
allows the user to choose how many discretization points will be used when creating
a curve or a surface out of this parameter.

\subsubsection{Parameters > Value}
Inputs: None
Fields: Name, Value
Outputs: Parameter Value

In a similar way to the Interval node, the Value node lets you define a parameter
and assign a specific value to it. You can use it either as a "variable"
to be used as input for a matrix (e.g. define a theta and then use theta as the
angle for a rotation matrix expressions) or as an input to the Sample Parameter node.



\subsubsection{Parameters > Sample Parameter}
Inputs: 1D or 2D Geometry object, Parameter Value
Fields: none
Outputs: 0D or 1D Geometry object

The parameter sampling operation allows you to "downgrade" the dimension of a parametric
Geometric object, by fixing the value of a parameter to the value given as input.

In order for the operation to succeed, the Geometry must have a parameter with the same name
as to the one used in the Value input (e.g. if a surface is $S(p, q)$, your value cannot
have the parameter name $r$, only $p$ or $q$ will be accepted). Please note that 1D Geometry created with the Bezi\`er
curve uses a hidden parameter name, and cannot therefore be sampled.

\subsection{Notes}
Assembling a graph does not have a 1:1 correspondency with writing procedural
code (e.g.: classical C code). You are only describing a series of
objects and a set of operations that manipulate those objects. The software
will then compute the correct order in which the operations that you defined
are to be executed to produce the final output.
