This software has been developed to help students understand and visualize
geometries created by manipulating points, parametric curves and parametric
surfaces.
Because of this reason it does not feature any advanced graphics capabilities
one would expect from a modern 3D software (including shadows,
reflections and such), but it will hopefully help you reason
about all the non-trivial concepts of the most common parametric objects.
